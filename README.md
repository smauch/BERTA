## About The Project

Over the semesters during the Corona Pandemic, seats in the KIT Library had to be reserved in advance. Since all the seats were often fully booked and you had to book anew every day, I automated this for myself and my friends.



## Installation

### Requirements
Ensure you have at least Python 3.8 installed. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
Create a config.ini file in the same directory as [main.py](BERTA/main.py). You can find an example for the parameters in the [config.ini.example](BERTA/config.ini.example).
